          <p>Inhabited for thousands of years archaeological evidence indicates that the Marianas Islands were one of the first places to be settled by seafaring peoples, possibly from Island Southeast Asia, over 4000 years ago. The Mariana Islands appear to have been continuously occupied by people who shared the same culture and language that eventually became known as Chamorro.</p>

          <p>Come and join us and explor Guams unique local culture. Guam is proud of its Chamorro culture, and we want to share it with you! Visit local workshops throughout the island to learn the dances, language, and crafts of our island.</p>

            <p>There is always something to celebrate on Guam, and we welcome our visitors to join us. Each of our island's 19 villages has its own festival day, or fiesta, where it's not unusual to see a village mayor working alongside the rest of the community to ensure the celebration is a success. Fiestas are a lively and intimate way for our visitors to get acquainted with the cultures of Guam's small but vibrant municipalities. Each village on Guam is united around its own patron saint, Catholic church, and a favorite town gathering place, providing the perfect setting for an authentic Chamorro cultural experience on fiesta day. </p>

          <p class="hide">Prefer to see the attractions Guam has to offer? want to experience the local fairs? A diverse mix of festivals and carnivals throughout the year give everyone something to look forward to.</p>

            <p>While family and faith is at the center of Chamorro culture, both often find their place at the fiesta table. Within the flower shape on the cover of our Guam Guide, you’ll find some of our island’s favorite foods – from red rice to chicken kelaguen. Please take time to explore our local cuisine and discover the fiesta table. It is there – during mealtimes – where families come together, new friendships are made, and old ones rekindled.</p>

            <p>The native food of Guam is largely based on what early ancestors could gather, grow and hunt from the land, plus what they could catch and harvest from the ocean. The Tree of Life, the coconut, offered much in the way of copra, oil, coconut water and coconut milk, as did many other fruit and vegetables.</p>
            <p>Fish and other seafood, and edible seaweed were bountiful, and later, colonial and occupational times allowed for more crops, better farming methods and a consistent harvest from Guam's lush volcanic soils.</p>
            <p class="hide">Guam is a leader in Pacific Rim cuisine and is at the forefront of the culinary revolution that embraced the world in the mid-90s. Its many talented cooks and chefs constantly push the standards of flavors and presentations, and it is easy to find a world-class meal on Guam.</p>
